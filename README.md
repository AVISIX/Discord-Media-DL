# Discord-Media-DL

This is my rather *simple* take on creating a Discord Media Downloader.

# How to use

Download the latest Version from the Releases section in this repository, then simply run it and answer the questions it asks you, after that it should automatically download all the Videos/Images from the Channel you have selected.

# How to Build

You will need .Net 5 for this, so make sure you have the runtime installed.
Since I am using external dependencies for, for example Json, I personally suggest Publishing the Program to a Folder and make it a single-executable application.

# Please Note !

This Program will use your Discord Token and create a Self-Bot! 
This **IS** against ToS, I do NOT take responsibility for any damaged caused by people using my Software!
